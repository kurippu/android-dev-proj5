# AND101 Project 5 - Choose Your Own API

Submitted by: **Angel Rivera**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Pokemon Finder** is an android app that **allows the user to search up pokemon to see a picture, name, and some of the basic stats.**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: üò¢ üò¢ üòê

## Application Features

<!-- (This is a comment) Please be sure to change the [ ] to [x] for any features you completed.  If a feature is not checked [x], you might miss the points for that item! -->

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [x] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [x] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [x] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is **I allowed the user to search up a pokemon of their choosing to get the stats. If there is no input then a toaster pops up telling the user that no input was received.**
- [x] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the app!

## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is **https://pokeapi.co**.

## Notes
This app was incredibly frustrating to make because for some reason my network prevented me from making a connection to the API. However the dog API from lab worked no problem. So I had spend most the project time addressing this issue. Also constraining views with each other just doesnt seem to work for me. I'm not sure why.
